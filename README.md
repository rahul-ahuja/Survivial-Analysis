# Survivial-Analysis

Took the dataset from https://resources.lendingclub.com/LoanStats3d.csv.zip and based on it, implemented a simple model that takes an input of 1 loan (which has the same parameters as a line in the spreadsheet) and calculates 2 things - 

i) the probability of the default of a loan
ii) the potential return of the loan.
